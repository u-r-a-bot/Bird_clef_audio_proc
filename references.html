                <h3>1. Abyssinian Thrush</h3>
                <p>
                    The Abyssinian thrush is a passerine bird in the family Turdidae. It is also known as the African
                    mountain thrush, or northern olive thrush The species was formerly treated as conspecific with the
                    olive thrush but the species were split based on the genetic differences. The ranges do not overlap.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Global Distribution:</strong>Eritrea, Africa</p>

                <h3>2. Black-headed Gonolek</h3>
                <p>
                    The black-headed gonolek is a distinctively coloured bush-shrike though it is generally shy and
                    retiring. However, close to human habitation and in gardens, it often becomes much bolder. It has a
                    very distinctive call which it makes in concert with its partner. The male makes a loud, clear,
                    bell-like sound to which the female responds almost simultaneously with a harsh grating response.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Global Distribution:</strong>African countries of Burundi, Cameroon, Central African
                    Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South
                    Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>

                <h3>3. Crowned hornbill</h3>
                <p>
                    It is a medium-sized bird, 50–54 centimetres (20–21 in) in length, and is characterized by its white
                    belly and black back and wings. The tips of the long tail feathers are white. The eyes are yellow;
                    the beak is red and presents a stocky casque on the upper mandible. In females, the casque is
                    smaller. The crowned hornbill can be distinguished from the similar Bradfield's hornbill by its
                    shorter beak.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Global Distribution:</strong>The crowned hornbill is a common resident of the coastal and
                    riverine forests of southern (only the eastern coast) to northeastern Africa.</p>

                <h3>5. Little Swift </h3>
                <p>
                    The Little Swift is a small, streamlined bird with dark plumage and long, scythe-like wings. It's
                    known for its rapid, agile flight and its habit of nesting on cliffs and buildings.

                <p><strong>Global Distribution:</strong>Found across much of sub-Saharan Africa, often in urban areas
                    where it nests on buildings.</p>
